# MTG Deck Optimizer - Milestone 1 Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What We've Built

**A fully functional Commander deck builder web application** that transforms your physical MTG collection into playable Commander decks through an intuitive web interface.

### Core Features Delivered:

1. **📊 Collection Management**
   - Reads CSV collection exports (ManaBox, Deckbox, etc.)
   - Enriches with complete Scryfall card data
   - Handles quantities and card variants

2. **🏛️ Commander Detection**
   - Automatically finds legal commanders in your collection
   - Validates Commander format legality
   - Displays comprehensive card information

3. **🎮 Interactive Web Interface**
   - Clean, responsive design with Magic-themed styling
   - Click-to-select commander cards with visual feedback
   - Real-time deck generation and display

4. **⚔️ Smart Deck Building**
   - Color identity validation (all cards match commander colors)
   - Format legality checking
   - Proper handling of basic lands and card quantities
   - Returns exactly 100 cards (1 commander + 99 deck)

5. **🔧 Technical Architecture**
   - Flask web framework with Jinja2 templates
   - Modular Python backend (utils, deckgen, app)
   - Proper data flow from CSV → Scryfall → Web UI
   - Error handling and edge case management
